# Python for Data Science - Weekly Exercises

This repository will contain the weekly exercises from the **Python for Data Science** course. Each week, new exercises will be added and building upon the concepts covered in the sessions.

## Session 1: Exercises

Session 1 focuses on Python basics like printing, variables, loops, lists, and simple functions. These tasks help me become comfortable with Python's core concepts.

### 1. **Print a Greeting**
   - Print a simple greeting message using Python.

### 2. **Basic Arithmetic**
   - Perform basic arithmetic operations with variables.

### 3. **String Manipulation**
   - Work with string formatting and variable assignment.

### 4. **Lists**
   - Create and manipulate lists by accessing and printing elements.

### 5. **Dictionaries**
   - Create a dictionary and print key-value pairs.

### 6. **Tuples**
   - Define a tuple and access its elements.

### 7. **Sets**
   - Create and manipulate sets by adding, removing, and merging elements.

### 8. **Conditional Statements**
   - Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions based on user input.

### 9. **For Loop**
   - Iterate through a list using a `for` loop.

### 10. **While Loop**
   - Implement a `while` loop to print numbers in a sequence.

### 11. **Match Statement (Python 3.10+)**
   - Use a `match` statement to map user input to specific output.

### 12. **Define a Function**
   - Write a simple function to greet a user by name.

### 13. **Function with Return Value**
   - Define a function that returns the square of a number.

### 14. **Function with Default Parameters**
   - Write a function that multiplies two numbers, with a default value for one parameter.

### 15. **List Comprehension**
   - Use list comprehension to create a new list from an existing one.

### 16. **Nested Data Structures**
   - Work with nested dictionaries and lists to calculate averages.

### 17. **Simple Calculator**
   - Build a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations based on user input.
