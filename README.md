# Session 7: DataFrame Manipulations with Pandas  

## Overview  
This session focuses on performing various DataFrame manipulations using Python's pandas library. The tasks involve creating new columns, merging DataFrames, and extracting specific details from text columns. These exercises aim to enhance your data preprocessing and transformation skills.  

## Exercises  

1. **Creating Professor Initials**  
   - Extract the initials of each professor's first and last names and store them in a new column called `professor_initials`.  

2. **Join DataFrames on Professor Column**  
   - Combine the original DataFrame with a new DataFrame (`df_courses`) using the `professor` column as the key.  

3. **Merge DataFrames to Include Course Information**  
   - Merge the original DataFrame and `df_courses` based on the common `professor` column to add course information for each professor.  

4. **Extract Professor Last Names**  
   - Use string operations to extract the last name of each professor from the `professor` column and store it in a new column called `professor_last_name`.
