# Session 8: Data Visualization with Seaborn  

## Overview  
In this session, we use Python's Seaborn library to visualize and analyze a dataset containing information about students, such as their study time, grades, courses, gender, and more. Each exercise focuses on creating a specific type of plot to derive insights from the data.

## Exercises  

1. **Lineplot: Study Time by Student Name**  
   Create a lineplot to visualize how study time varies by student and identify the student with the highest study time.  

2. **Histogram: Grade Distribution**  
   Create a histogram (histplot) to visualize the frequency distribution of grades and determine which grade range has the highest frequency of students.  

3. **ECDF Plot: Cumulative Grade Distribution**  
   Plot an ECDF (ecdfplot) to show the cumulative percentage of grades and calculate the percentage of students scoring below 85.  

4. **Stripplot: Grade Distribution by Course**  
   Create a stripplot to visualize individual grade distributions for each course and identify the course with the most spread in grades.  

5. **Swarmplot: Gender and Study Time**  
   Plot a swarmplot to analyze the relationship between gender and study time and determine which gender has a higher average study time.  

6. **Pointplot: Average Grade by Course**  
   Create a pointplot to compare the average grade across courses and identify the course with the highest average grade.
